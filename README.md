# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This project is about sorting algorithms and Big O notations.

## Sorting algorithms

- Bubble sort: The simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

- Insertion sort: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

- Selection sort: The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
